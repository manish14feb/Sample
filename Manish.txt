Absolutely! Imagine you're on a road trip in a car, and the road isn't perfectly smooth. Sometimes you hit a bump or a pothole, right? Well, in an airplane, it's kind of like that, but in the sky.

Airplane turbulence happens when the plane encounters pockets of air that are moving in different directions or at different speeds. It's like a little rollercoaster ride, but nothing to worry about. Pilots are trained to handle it, and planes are designed to withstand it.

Think of it like sailing on a slightly bumpy sea – the boat may sway a bit, but it's built to handle it. Turbulence might make the plane shake or jiggle, but it's just the plane adjusting to the air currents. So, if you ever feel turbulence during a flight, just stay seated and enjoy the ride – it's completely normal!
